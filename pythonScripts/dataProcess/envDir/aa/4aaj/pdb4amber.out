Summary of pdb4amber for file 4aaj_A.pdb
==================================================

----------Chains
The following (original) chains have been found:
A

---------- Alternate Locations (Original Residues!)
The following residues had alternate locations:
HIS_99
The alternate coordinates have been discarded.
Only the first occurrence for each atom was kept.

---------- Histidines (Renumbered Residues!)
It was not possible to determine the protonation state of the following HIS
residues based on presence of hydrogens. Amber will consider them as HIE
(epsilon-HIS) by default. If other protonation state desired change to HID
(delta-HIS) or HIP (protonated HIS) by hand.
HIS_80
HIS_1
HIS_136
HIS_21

---------- Cysteines in Disulfide Bonds (Renumbered Residues!)
No disulfide bonds have been detected.

---------- Gaps (Renumbered Residues!)
gap of 6.743632 A between THR_135 and HIS_136
You MUST (!!!) insert a TER record between the residues listed above and
consider to introduce caps (ACE and NME) at the dangling N- and C-terminals.

---------- Missing Heavy Atoms (Renumbered Residues!)
LYS_110 misses 5 heavy atom(s)
HIS_136 misses 6 heavy atom(s)
