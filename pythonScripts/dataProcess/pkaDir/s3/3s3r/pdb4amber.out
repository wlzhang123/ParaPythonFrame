==================================================

----------Chains
The following (original) chains have been found:
A

---------- Histidines (Renumbered Residues!)
It was not possible to determine the protonation state of the following HIS
residues based on presence of hydrogens. Amber will consider them as HIE
(epsilon-HIS) by default. If other protonation state desired change to HID
(delta-HIS) or HIP (protonated HIS) by hand.
HIS_192
HIS_98
HIS_201
HIS_111
HIS_112
HIS_147

---------- Cysteines in Disulfide Bonds (Renumbered Residues!)
CYS_16 - CYS_45: S-S distance = 2.036971 Ang.
CYS_28 - CYS_72: S-S distance = 2.048171 Ang.
CYS_64 - CYS_130: S-S distance = 2.049506 Ang.
CYS_65 - CYS_68: S-S distance = 2.045962 Ang.
CYS_101 - CYS_134: S-S distance = 2.038445 Ang.
CYS_109 - CYS_120: S-S distance = 2.042974 Ang.
The above CYS have been renamed to CYX in the new PDB file.
Disulfide bond CONECT cards have been added to the new PDB file.

---------- Missing Heavy Atoms (Renumbered Residues!)
None
