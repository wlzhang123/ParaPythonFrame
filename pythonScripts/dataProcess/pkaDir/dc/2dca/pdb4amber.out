==================================================

----------Chains
The following (original) chains have been found:
A

---------- Histidines (Renumbered Residues!)
It was not possible to determine the protonation state of the following HIS
residues based on presence of hydrogens. Amber will consider them as HIE
(epsilon-HIS) by default. If other protonation state desired change to HID
(delta-HIS) or HIP (protonated HIS) by hand.
HIS_45
HIS_197
HIS_108
HIS_109
HIS_143
HIS_237
HIS_188
HIS_95

---------- Cysteines in Disulfide Bonds (Renumbered Residues!)
CYS_14 - CYS_43: S-S distance = 2.030838 Ang.
CYS_26 - CYS_69: S-S distance = 2.034177 Ang.
CYS_60 - CYS_126: S-S distance = 2.036551 Ang.
CYS_61 - CYS_65: S-S distance = 2.025170 Ang.
CYS_98 - CYS_130: S-S distance = 2.032524 Ang.
CYS_106 - CYS_117: S-S distance = 2.029362 Ang.
CYS_146 - CYS_250: S-S distance = 2.034708 Ang.
The above CYS have been renamed to CYX in the new PDB file.
Disulfide bond CONECT cards have been added to the new PDB file.
