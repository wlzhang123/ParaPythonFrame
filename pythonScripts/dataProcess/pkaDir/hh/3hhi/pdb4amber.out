Summary of pdb4amber for file 3hhi_A.pdb
==================================================

----------Chains
The following (original) chains have been found:
A

---------- Alternate Locations (Original Residues!)
The following residues had alternate locations:
GLU_80
ARG_147
SER_153
HIS_250
The alternate coordinates have been discarded.
Only the first occurrence for each atom was kept.

---------- Histidines (Renumbered Residues!)
It was not possible to determine the protonation state of the following HIS
residues based on presence of hydrogens. Amber will consider them as HIE
(epsilon-HIS) by default. If other protonation state desired change to HID
(delta-HIS) or HIP (protonated HIS) by hand.
HIS_195
HIS_196
HIS_205
HIS_114
HIS_117
HIS_118
HIS_68

---------- Cysteines in Disulfide Bonds (Renumbered Residues!)
CYS_30 - CYS_59: S-S distance = 2.049919 Ang.
CYS_42 - CYS_85: S-S distance = 2.085426 Ang.
CYS_77 - CYS_138: S-S distance = 2.043877 Ang.
CYS_78 - CYS_81: S-S distance = 2.059739 Ang.
CYS_107 - CYS_142: S-S distance = 2.111243 Ang.
CYS_115 - CYS_128: S-S distance = 2.030053 Ang.
The above CYS have been renamed to CYX in the new PDB file.
Disulfide bond CONECT cards have been added to the new PDB file.

---------- Missing Heavy Atoms (Renumbered Residues!)
None
